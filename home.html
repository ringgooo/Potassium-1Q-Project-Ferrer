                <p>High agricultural costs, rising food prices, and an over-reliance on imports are pushing farmers toward poverty and leaving people hungry in the Philippines. “We can’t afford to waste a day,” Nazar told The New Humanitarian. “We don’t earn anything during harvests. We just survive. We’re practically giving away our crops.”     
                Recent events beyond their control – the COVID-19 pandemic, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and weather-related disasters – have made life increasingly precarious for farmers like Nazar, raising concerns about rising hunger in the Philippines, an archipelago of more than 7,000 islands and some 109 million people.
